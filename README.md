# Welcome
Pete Spangler's repository of assignments and practice files for [Udacity Data Structures Algorithms Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)

Looking back, I took this course too early in my programming journey. There were concepts that did not really take hold in my mind until after I had struggled through these problems and was working through the two other Udacity nanodegrees I completed. 

## Project 0: Unscramble Computer Science Problems:
- [Code](./P0)
- Solved 5 problems and performed [efficiency analysis](./P0/Analysis.txt) on the solutions.

## Project 1: Data Structures:
- [Code](./P1)
- Solved 6 open ended questions and performed [efficiency analysis](./P1/Show.Me.The.Data.Structures/explanation.txt) on the solutions.

## Project 2: Basic Algorithms:
- [Code](./P2)
- Solved 7 problems utilizing basic/sorting/divide and conquer algorithms reviewed in this section of the course.
- Performed [efficiency analysis](./P2/Problems_vs_Algorithms/Analysis.md) on all 7 problems.

## Project 3: Advanced Algorithms:
- [Code](./P3)
- Implemented A* algorithm as a solution for a Route Planner problem. 
- Would have been significantly more difficult if not for the visualization project found on [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A).
