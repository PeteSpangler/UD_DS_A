This problem was implemented with a Trie, as in the problem statement is titled "Autocomplete with Tries". Using the Trie structure as shown in the Basic algorithm section of this unit, space and time complexity are good for the proposed purpose. The time complexity for a Trie depends on the # of words in the Trie and length of the word that is being inserted or searched for, so O(word length * number of total words in trie). Space complexity is O(total words - shared letters between those words) so worst case it could be O(n) space.
