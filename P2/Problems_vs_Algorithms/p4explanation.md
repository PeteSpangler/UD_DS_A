To sort the given array of 0,1,2 in one pass, three pointers are used. A pointer as the iterator through the whole array, a pointer for the 0s, and a pointer for the 2s, and by swapping values of 0s and 2s as necessary, the 1s end up in the middle where they should be. This is a one pass solution (linear time complexity O(n)) with O(1) space complexity.
