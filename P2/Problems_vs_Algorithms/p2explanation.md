This has a similar solution to P1: binary search is implemented on the given array to identify the target value. The variation comes in the rotated array parameter, which is checked in the binary search algorithmâ€™s implementation in lines 20-29. This is a variation of the usual increment/decrement low/high values in a vanilla binary search algorithm. This is to see if the pivot point from which the array has been rotated is on the right or left side of the array, to then set up the algorithm to work on the correct side of the array. Time Complexity is O(log n) because of the use of binary search and time complexity is O(1) because the algorithm does not use extra space to run.
