Task 0 worst case time complexity is 0(1) because it is not searching for
anything, it is printing what it is directed to do. There are no
other steps except printing the assigned values.

Task 1 worst case time complexity is O(n) because there are no nested loops, just a few iterations over the lists
that are worst case O(n) on their own so when added, it simplifies to O(n)

Task 2 worst case time complexity is also O(n) because it simplifies down to that, several O(n) operations
but no squares or log n functions to speed it up or slow it down.

Task 3 worst case time complexity simplifies down to O(n log n) due to use of the sorted function, all other
functions and operations have run time of O(1) or O(n).

Task 4 worst case time complexity is roughly the same as Task 3. Another sorted function call bumps this up 
to O(n log n) and all other functions and operations have run time of O(1) or O(n).
